# Blockchain Database

## Introduction

Blockchain Database is an npm package that combines the security of blockchain technology with the data storage capabilities of MongoDB. It allows users to store data in a secure, tamper-proof, and immutable database. This package is designed for applications and use cases where data integrity and immutability are crucial.

## Why Blockchain in Databases?

Traditional databases provide efficient data storage and retrieval but often lack the ability to ensure data integrity and immutability. Blockchain technology addresses these limitations by offering:

- **Immutable Records:** Data stored in the blockchain cannot be altered, providing an immutable history of changes.

- **Decentralization:** Blockchain databases are distributed across a network of nodes, reducing the risk of a single point of failure and enhancing security.

- **Transparency and Trust:** Transactions are publicly recorded on the blockchain, fostering trust and transparency among users.

- **Security:** Cryptographic techniques ensure the security of data and transactions.

By integrating blockchain technology into databases, you can enhance data security, prevent unauthorized modifications, and provide a reliable and tamper-proof record of data changes.

## Features

- **Secure Data Storage:** Store data in a MongoDB database with added security through blockchain technology.

- **Immutable Records:** Data stored in the blockchain cannot be altered, providing an immutable history of changes.

- **Data Integrity:** Verify the integrity of your data at any time by checking it against the blockchain.

- **NPM Package:** Easily integrate the Blockchain Database package into your Node.js applications.

- **Customizable:** Configure the package to suit your specific project requirements.

## Usage
const BlockchainDatabase = require('blockchain-database');

// Initialize the Blockchain Database
const blockchainDB = new BlockchainDatabase({
    // Configure options here
});

// Store data in the database
blockchainDB.storeData('Your data goes here')
    .then((result) => {
        console.log('Data stored successfully:', result);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error('Error storing data:', error);
    });

## Configuration 

You can configure the Blockchain Database package according to your needs. Here are some of the configurable options:

- **Blockchain Network:** Specify the blockchain network to use (e.g., Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric).

- **MongoDB Connection:** Set up the MongoDB connection details.

- **Security:** Configure encryption and access control settings.
